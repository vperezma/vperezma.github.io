			<h1>What is Github?</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>code sharing and publishing service.</li>
				<li>social network for programmers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>think of github as a filing cabinet for a document and all its revisions. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>great for team work.</li>
				<li>great for gaining further programming knowledge.
					<ul>
						<li>look at other coders work and make it better or just play with their code (always give credit) <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license">MIT license breakdown</a> </li>
						<li>I know it is currently not important to learn about the MIT license but do note that if it is a public ‘repo’ your code is fair game to fork. https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing/"> The MIT Open Source license</a>

			<p><strong>so lets break github down!</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Git</strong>: is a version control system.</p>
			<p><strong>who started git?</strong> Linus Torvalds the creator of the Linux operating system.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds"> Linus' Wikipedia</a></p>
			<p><strong>what is a version control system?</strong> - As future developers you will be working with projects that contain several versions and modifications to your already existing code.
			A version control system such as git keeps all the revisions and modifications in a central repository or ‘repo’. Within that repo you are able to create multiple branches that are able to be forked or cloned. When you fork a project, modify it and create a pull request the original developer can approve your pull request and move it to the ‘master branch’. (we will talk about fork, clone, push, commit and hosting sites on github.io in just a bit.)</p>
			<p><strong>Hub:</strong> this is github.com, the social network part of git. Here is where all the magic happens. Developers can store projects and network with likeminded folks.

		<div class="vocab">
			<p><strong>Now some vocab. that is commonly used in github.</strong></p>

			<p><strong>repository:</strong> A location where all files for a particular project are stored.  Each project will have its own repo and can be accessed by a unique URL.</p>

			<p><strong>Forking:</strong> This is when a new repo is created off another users already existing repo. This is were you gain your reputation as a code ninja. Once you fork a repo you can modify it however you want and push your changes back to github. By forking you make it easier for github and yourself to push changes back to the original repo and creating pull requests.</p>

			<p><strong>pull request:</strong> After making the code you forked awesome you want the original developer to notice it. In order for him to notice it, you will create a pull request that will allow the original developer to compare your code to their code and see what changes you made, and if he likes them he will merge the two files. This also allows for both developers to converse about the code. </p>

			<p><strong>cloning:</strong> a clone of a repository is a copy that lives in your computer. This allows you to make changes without affecting the current project in the server somewhere. if you clone another users project to just try it out cloning makes it easier to push to your personal repo.</p>

			<p><strong>commit:</strong> this is an individual change to a file or set of files. Commit creates a unique id that allows you to find out when and who made changes. With commits you also want to include a short message that describes the changes.</p>

			<p><strong>push:</strong> This sends your committed changes to a repository on github. This is something you do after changing something locally and want others to change it.</p>

			<p>Now lets try to get our github accounts started by going to <a href=" https://github.com/"> github. </a></p>
			<p>If you don’t have any command line experience github provides this awesome GUI that’s simple to use.</p> 
			<p>for windows users:<a href= "https://windows.github.com/"> Windows </a></p>
			<p>for mac user:<a href="https://mac.github.com/"> mac </a></p>
			<p>for chromebook users: Sorry, there is currently nothing  available from github.(see me to plan out your next step.)</p>
			<p>for linux users: all command line and git for you :)</p>

			<p>Now we will create a public repo that we will use to present our final projects and we will be following the steps used here:<a href="https://pages.github.com/"> github pages </a></p>

			<p>it seems like a lot to pick up in such a short amount of time so don’t hesitate to ask questions.
