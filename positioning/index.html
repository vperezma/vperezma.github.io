		<p>The display property controls the layout. Every element with learned so far in this class has a default display value depending on what type of element is. </p>

		<p>A block element is an element that takes up the full width available, and has a line break before and after it.</p>
		<p>Examples of block elements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>h2</li>
			<li>p</li>
			<li>li</li>
			<li>div</li>
		</ul>
		<p>An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary, and does not force line breaks.</p>
		<p>Examples of inline elements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>span</li>
			<li>a</li>
		</ul>

		<p>div is the standard block-level element. A block-level element starts on a new line and stretches out to the left and right as far as it can. Other common block-level elements are p and form, and new in HTML5 are header, footer, section, and more.</p>

		<p>span is the standard inline element. An inline element can wrap some text inside a paragraph <span> like this </span> without disrupting the flow of that paragraph. The a element is the most common inline element, since you use them for links.</p>
		<p>**Although all of these elements have set display values you can always override them as needed.</p>

		<p><b>display: inline-block</b></p>
		<p>With inline-block we are telling the browser to display the element inline but allow it to keep its block level status therefore allowing it to create a new row once the browser ends.</p>

		<h2>Let's go over positioning vocabulary</h2>
		<p>static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.</p>
		<p>relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.</p>

		<p>Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</p>

		<p>A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used.</p>
